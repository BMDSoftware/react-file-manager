![React File Manager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53b09633-220e-460d-a5a5-48f553640dd0)

An open-source React.js package for easy integration of a file manager into applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing files and folders, including viewing, uploading, and deleting, with full UI and backend integration.

## ‚ú® Features

- **File & Folder Management**: View, upload, delete, copy, move, create, and rename files or folders seamlessly.
- **Grid & List View**: Switch between grid and list views to browse files in your preferred layout.
- **Navigation**: Use the breadcrumb trail and sidebar navigation pane for quick directory traversal.
- **Toolbar & Context Menu**: Access all common actions (upload, delete, copy, move, rename, etc.) via the toolbar or right-click for the same options in the context menu.

## üöÄ Installation

To install `React File Manager`, use the following command:

```bash
npm i @cubone/react-file-manager
```

## üíª Usage

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the File Manager Component in your React application:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { FileManager } from "@cubone/react-file-manager";
import "@cubone/react-file-manager/dist/style.css";

function App() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState([
    {
      name: "Documents",
      isDirectory: true, // Folder
      path: "/Documents", // Located in Root directory
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T10:30:00Z", // Last updated time (ISO 8601 format)
    },
    {
      name: "Pictures",
      isDirectory: true, // Folder
      path: "/Pictures", // Located in Root directory
      updatedAt: "2024-09-09T11:00:00Z", // Last updated time (ISO 8601 format)
    },
    {
      name: "Pic.png",
      isDirectory: false, // File
      path: "/Pictures/Pic.png", // Located inside the "Pictures" folder
      updatedAt: "2024-09-08T16:45:00Z", // Last updated time (ISO 8601 format)
      size: 2048, // File size in bytes (example: 2 KB)
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <>
      <FileManager files={files} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## üìÇ File Structure

The `files` prop accepts an array of objects, where each object represents a file or folder. You can customize the structure to meet your application needs. Each file or folder object follows the structure detailed below:

```typescript
type File = {
  name: string;
  isDirectory: boolean;
  path: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
  size?: number;
};
```
